        <h2>What is Bread?</h2>
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bread">Merriam-Webster</a>, bread is "a usually baked and leavened food made of a mixture whose basic constituent is flour or meal". Due to this, bread has many healthy benefits!</p>

        <p>Some of these benefits are but not limited to...</p>

        <h2>But Which Bread Shall I <em id="consume">Consume?</em></h2>
        <p>There are many different types of bread, and some types of bread are much healthier than others. For example, whole wheat bread contains more fiber, has a higher nutritional value, and may have lower calories.</p>
        <p> However, some breads can taste better than others, even though it isn't as healthy as others are. For example, I myself prefer the taste of white bread over wheat bread, but wheat bread is healthier so I prefer wheat bread.</p>
